# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Description

This project presents a robust framework for predicting the prices of used cars through the application of multiple linear regression models. Leveraging a diverse dataset comprising key parameters such as brand, engine volume, engine type, year, mileage, and other relevant features, our approach aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions for the resale value of pre-owned vehicles. The research begins by collecting and preprocessing historical data from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the used car market. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted to identify the most influential factors affecting the pricing dynamics.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **StatsModels**: Statistical models and hypothesis tests

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the car
- **Price**: Price of the used car
- **Body**: Type of the car body (e.g., sedan, hatchback)
- **Mileage**: Distance the car has traveled
- **Engine Volume**: Volume of the car's engine
- **Engine Type**: Type of the engine (e.g., petrol, diesel)
- **Registration**: Registration details of the car
- **Year**: Year of manufacture
- **Model**: Model of the car
